# Electromagnetism and Quantum Computing 101

This is a fast paced introductory course to the fundementals of electromagnetism and quantum computing

## Day 1 - Electrostatics

- [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/ap-physics-1/ap-electric-charge-electric-force-and-voltage)
- [Experiment: electrostatics](https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/balloons-and-static-electricity/latest/balloons-and-static-electricity_en.html)
- [Experiment: charge distributions](https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/charges-and-fields/latest/charges-and-fields_en.html)

## Day(s) 2,3 - Circuits

- **Before class**
  - Please complete all quick quizes: [DC Circuits](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/ap-physics-1/ap-circuits-topic)
  - Read this [Whirlwind introduction to DC circuits](https://www.electronicshub.org/dc-circuits-basics/). This may be helpful
- In class we will design, [simulate](https://www.circuitlab.com/), and then build our own circuits!

## Day(s) 3-5 - Magnetism

- **Before class**:
  - watch [this](https://youtu.be/s94suB5uLWw), [this](https://youtu.be/pQp6bmJPU_0), [this](https://youtu.be/5fqwJyt4Lus), and finally (optional) [this](https://youtu.be/K40lNL3KsJ4)
  - skim [this](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/ap-physics-2/ap-magnetic-forces-and-magnetic-fields)
- We will discuss particle accelerator basics in class

## Day 6 - Quantum Science

- You might want to skim [this](https://openstax.org/books/university-physics-volume-3/pages/7-introduction) before class to better understand
- We will discuss modern physics concepts with these simulators:
  - [magnetostatics](https://www.falstad.com/vector3dm/)
  - [electromagnetics](https://www.falstad.com/emwave2/)
  - [quantum oscillations](https://www.falstad.com/qm3dosc/)
  - [atomic orbitals](https://www.falstad.com/qmatom/)
  - [molecular wave functions](https://www.falstad.com/qmmo/)
  - [molecule 5](https://www.myphysicslab.com/)
- Select our [particle accelerator](https://github.com/JacobFV/particle-accelerator) design

## Day 7 - Quantum Computing

- **Before class**:
  - [ ] Please read [this repository](https://github.com/JacobFV/Quantum-Computing) and explore the different quantum compute providers
  - [ ] Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvTqbM5Dq4Q)
  - [ ] Read the first 5 articles ("What is a QBit" through "Hello Quantum World") [here](https://www.quantum-inspire.com/kbase/introduction-to-quantum-computing/)
- We will write and run some quantum computing algorithms
- Start planning your capstone quantum program

## Day 8 - Particle Accelerator
- **Before class**:
  1. [Create](https://github.com/) a github account
  2. [make a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/create-a-repo)
  3. [upload](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/adding-a-file-to-a-repository) your quantum programs from last class
- We will work on the particle accelerator
- Discuss any issues with your quantum program

## Day 9 - Review and Publish
- **Before class** write 2 pages about what you learned over this 4 week course
- **Capstone Assignment** present a working quantum program. We will then deploy it on a physical quantum computer
- We will publish our findings on multiple mediums (potentially including: Instructables, TowardsDataScience, Github,
